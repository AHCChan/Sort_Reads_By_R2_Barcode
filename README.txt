                    - People fortunate enough to be really, REALLY good at Regex



REQUIREMENTS

This program requires the NSeq_Match library.

This program runs in Python 2. It will not work properly with Python 3.
Please ensure you have Python 2 installed on your computer.
Please ensure you are using the correct version of Python to run this program.



INSTRUCTIONS (SETUP)

You don't need to know how to use git to get this program, nor the libraries 
which this program needs to run.

You can simply open the files:
        NSeq_Match.py
        Sort_by_r2_BCode.py
... in your online browser and copy their contents onto a local file on your
computer with the same name. Ensure that these files are in the same folder.

Supporting files are available at:
        https://github.com/AHCChan/NSeq_Match



INSTRUCTIONS (RUN)

To run the program, open up a command line window and enter the following
command (substituting the appropriate file paths) to bring up the help doc:

    C:\Path\To\Python\python.exe C:\Path\To\The\File\Sort_by_r2_BCode.py -h

You should get a large wall of text explaining how to use this program, along
with some examples.

Alternatively, Sort_by_r2_BCode code can be used as a module by other Python 
programs using standard import methods.



TESTING AND FEEDBACK

The files provided in the Testing folder can be used as a reference for making
sure the program works properly and/or for implementing this in another 
language.

The example data (Test_1_r1.fq, Test_2_r2.fq) was used by the commands in the 
script file (Testing_Commands.txt) to derive the other files.

Feel free to contact Angelo Chan (angelo.hoi.chung.chan@gmail.com) if you have
any questions, feedback, or bugs to report.
